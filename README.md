# QuizTing 

Interactive quiz which Android devices connect to the same
network and compete against each other. We also provide a desktop application for
the quiz to easily be set up and controlled. The application is best used in a social
environment where everyone can get together and play and not have the hassle of
the traditional paper and pen quiz system.
